## 🧰 Git Commands

### `git stash`
- Temporarily saves your uncommitted changes (working directory + staged changes).
- Useful when you need to quickly switch branches without committing unfinished work.

### `git reset --hard`
- Resets your branch to the last commit and **deletes all local uncommitted changes**.
- ⚠️ Dangerous: you will lose work unless it’s committed or stashed.

## 🤖 AI Tools Mentioned (for UI / site generation)

Trainer recommended exploring AI tools for generating UI designs and quickly prototyping:

- **download cowork (by Claude)** — recommended by trainer
- **lovable.dev** — better design quality
- **v0.app** — faster generation
- **bolt.new** — also strong design output

Trainer also showed how to take AI-generated designs and integrate them into the project.
