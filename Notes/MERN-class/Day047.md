# MERN Class Notes

**Date:** 30 Jan 2026, Friday  
**Topic:** Redux Toolkit Basics

### Key Concepts

1. **useSelector**  
   - Pulls data from the Redux store (state).  
   - Think of it like reading the current value of your app’s global state.

2. **useDispatch**  
   - Function used to request updates to the state.  
   - You "dispatch" actions, and reducers handle the changes.

3. **Reducer Slices**  
   - Break your Redux store into multiple "slices".  
   - Each slice manages its own part of the state, making it easier to organize.

4. **Reducer Function**  
   - Receives `state` and `action` as parameters.  
   - Example flow: **Old state → Reducer function → New state**

### Example Code: Box Component

```typescript
'use client'
import { incrementHeight } from '@/lib/features/box/boxSlice'
import React from 'react'
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux'

const Box = () => {
    // Pulling height and width from redux store
    const { height, width } = useSelector(state => state.box)

    const dispatch = useDispatch()

    return (
        <div>
            <div style={{ height, width, background: 'red' }}></div>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch(incrementHeight())}>
                Increment height
            </button>
        </div>
    )
}

export default Box
```

# Explanation:

useSelector -> reads the current height and width from the Redux store.

useDispatch -> lets you trigger the incrementHeight() action to update the state.

When the button is clicked, the height of the red box increases.

## Quick Recap: 

- Redux stores app-wide state.

- useSelector = read state, useDispatch = update state.

- Break state into slices for better organization.

- Reducers take state + action → return new state.
