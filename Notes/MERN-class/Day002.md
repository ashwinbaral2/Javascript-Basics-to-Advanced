**Interview Prep & Coding Foundations**

---

## 🟠 1️⃣ GOOGLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

**📌 WHAT GOOGLE LOOKS FOR:**

- **🎯 Problem-Solving Skills**
  - Ability to break down complex problems
  - Think step-by-step through challenges
  - Ask clarifying questions

- **🎯 Communication**
  - Explain your logic clearly
  - Discuss trade-offs
  - Show your thought process (not just code!)

- **🎯 Algorithms & Data Structures**
  - Write efficient code
  - Understand time & space complexity
  - Know Big O notation

**💡 KEY INSIGHT:**  
Google values **CLEAR THINKING** + **STRUCTURED APPROACH** more than fancy or complex code!

## 🟠 2️⃣ COMPETITIVE CODING

**📌 WHAT IS IT?**

Solving algorithmic problems under time constraints on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeChef, Codeforces.

**✅ BENEFITS:**
- Sharpens logic & pattern recognition
- Speeds up problem-solving abilities
- Builds confidence with algorithms
- Great for interview preparation
- Fun & challenging community

**⚠️ NOT MANDATORY FOR:**
- Most regular dev jobs (especially early-career)
- Frontend-heavy positions
- Startup roles (focus more on shipping features)

**💡 THE BALANCE:**  
Do competitive coding because you ENJOY it, not because you MUST. It's a tool to sharpen skills, not a requirement.

## 🟠 3️⃣ PSEUDOCODE

**📌 WHAT IS IT?**

Writing code logic in plain English (or simple statements) without worrying about syntax.

**🎯 WHY IT'S IMPORTANT IN INTERVIEWS:**
- Shows clear thinking before coding
- Interviewer can follow your logic
- Easier to fix logical errors
- Demonstrates problem-solving approach
- Saves time writing actual code

**💡 EXAMPLE:**

Problem: Find the largest number in an array

**PSEUDOCODE:**
1. Create a variable 'max' and set it to first element
2. Loop through array starting from second element
3. If current element > max, update max
4. Return max

Then write actual code based on this logic!

## 🟠 4️⃣ TECH DEBT

**📌 WHAT IS IT?**

"Unfinished" or messy code that slows down future development.

Think of it like taking a loan:
- You get short-term benefit (ship faster)
- But you pay interest (harder to maintain later)

**📝 EXAMPLES OF TECH DEBT:**
- Hardcoded values instead of config files
- Copy-pasted code instead of reusable functions
- Missing error handling
- No documentation or comments
- Outdated dependencies

**🎯 HOW TO REDUCE TECH DEBT:**
- Write clean code from day one
- Refactor regularly
- Test your code
- Document important logic
- Keep dependencies updated

**💡 BALANCE:**  
Some tech debt is okay when shipping fast matters, but ALWAYS plan to pay it back!

## 🟠 5️⃣ DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS (DSA)

**📌 DSA IMPORTANCE:**
- ESSENTIAL for interviews (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.)
- Helps write efficient code
- Shows you understand fundamentals
- Critical for system design

**⚠️ FOR WHICH JOBS:**
- HIGH priority: Tech companies, senior roles, FAANG
- MEDIUM priority: Startups, mid-level positions
- LOW priority: Small agencies, junior roles (still good to know!)

**💡 WHAT TO FOCUS ON:**
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees & Graphs
- Hash Maps
- Sorting & Searching
- Two Pointers, Sliding Window
- Dynamic Programming (advanced)

## 🟠 6️⃣ DEEP CLONING IN JAVASCRIPT

**📌 WHAT IS DEEP CLONING?**

Creating a complete, independent copy of an object/array, including all nested objects and arrays.

**🎯 WHY IT MATTERS:**

Without deep cloning, you might accidentally modify the original data when you think you're working with a copy!

**✍️ METHODS:**

**❌ SHALLOW COPY** (doesn't work for nested objects):
```javascript
const copy = { ...original };     // Spread operator
const copy = Object.assign({}, original);
```

**✅ DEEP COPY** (works for nested objects):
```javascript
const copy = structuredClone(original);  // Modern & best
const copy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));  // Older method
const copy = _.cloneDeep(original);  // Using Lodash library
```

**💡 EXAMPLE:**
```javascript
const user = { name: "John", address: { city: "NYC" } };

// Shallow: const copy = {...user};
// → Modifying copy.address.city ALSO changes user.address.city! ❌

// Deep: const copy = structuredClone(user);
// → Modifying copy.address.city does NOT affect user! ✅
```

## 🎯 QUICK SUMMARY

- ✓ Understand interview expectations
- ✓ Competitive coding sharpens skills (optional but helpful)
- ✓ Pseudocode → Write code (always!)
- ✓ Reduce tech debt for maintainability
- ✓ DSA is crucial for tech interviews
- ✓ Deep clone when working with nested data
