git reset                     → undo commits/unstage changes (local)
---

3) Branching & Navigation
---
git branch                    → list/create/delete branches

---

6) History, Inspection, Debugging

git show commitID             → details of specific commit
git blame filename            → see who edited each line
git tag v1.0.0                → mark version/release
---

7) Undoing & Cleanup
---
git revert commitID           → undo safely with new commit

git restore filename          → restore file
git stash                     → temporarily save uncommitted work
git clean                     → remove untracked files
---

8) Additional Commands
---

// delete branch locally
git branch -d localBranchName

// delete branch remotely
git push origin --delete remoteBranchName

// to undo push in the main from branch 
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push origin main --force
