## 🧩 React Components — Basics

### What Was Learned
- Learned how to build common UI components:
  - **Navbar**
  - **Sidebar**
- Focus on **component-based UI structure**

---

## 🧠 Component Concept

- Components are **reusable**
- A component can contain **other components** (nested components)

Example hierarchy:

```bash

Root (App) Component
├── Header Component
├── Navbar Component
├── Sidebar Component
└── Footer Component

```

> Think LEGO blocks, not monolithic stone statues.

---

## ⚛️ Types of Components

### 1. Stateless Functional Components
- Function-based
- No internal state (traditionally)
- Lightweight and clean
- Most commonly used today

```js
function Navbar() {
  return <nav>Navbar</nav>
}
```

---

### 2. Stateful Class Components

* Class-based
* Can manage internal state
* Older React pattern (still exists, less common)

```js
class Sidebar extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <aside>Sidebar</aside>
  }
}
```

> Modern React favors **functional components + hooks**.

---

## 📦 Export vs Export Default

### `export`

* Named export
* Can export multiple items from a file
* Must be imported using the same name

```js
export const Navbar = () => {}
```

```js
import { Navbar } from "./Navbar"
```

---

### `export default`

* Default export
* Only one per file
* Can be imported with **any name**

```js
export default Navbar
```

```js
import Navbar from "./Navbar"
```

> Using `export`, the component can be used in **any other page** by importing it.

---

## 🧬 JSX (JavaScript XML)

* **JSX = JavaScript XML**
* Allows writing HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript
* Used by React to define UI structure

```js
const element = <h1>Hello World</h1>
```

> JSX is NOT HTML — it gets compiled into JavaScript.

## 🧑‍💻 Useful Coding Tools & Editors

### Google Antigravity

* Free
* Code editor
* Useful apps for coding

### Cursor

* Paid
* AI-powered code editor
* Helps with:

  * Code completion
  * Refactoring
  * Debugging

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

* React apps are built using **components**
* Components are:

  * Reusable
  * Nestable
* JSX bridges JavaScript and UI
* Understanding `export` vs `export default` is critical
* Functional components dominate modern React
