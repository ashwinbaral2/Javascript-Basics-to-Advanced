## 🗳️ Class Project Recommendation (My Pitch)

# 🌋 Real-Time Disaster & Relief Coordination Platform (MERN)

## 📌 Project Overview
A **real-time disaster reporting and relief coordination platform** built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

This project is designed for Nepal-like contexts where disasters such as:
- Earthquakes
- Floods
- Landslides
- Fires
- Road blockages  

require **fast reporting**, **verification**, and **coordinated response**.

### The system enables:
- Citizens to report incidents with **location + media**
- Responders to **verify** and prioritize incidents
- Volunteers to accept relief tasks and update progress
- Admins to monitor activity, detect false reports, and view analytics

---

## 🎯 Key Goals
- Enable **fast and reliable disaster reporting**
- Prevent misinformation using a **verification workflow**
- Coordinate responders and volunteers efficiently
- Provide a **live incident map view**
- Track response progress and resource distribution in real-time

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 User Roles

### 1) Citizen
- Report disaster incidents (earthquake damage, landslide, flood, fire, etc.)
- Upload photos/videos
- Pin incident location on map
- Request urgent help (food, medical, rescue, shelter)

### 2) Volunteer
- View verified incidents nearby
- Accept tasks assigned by responders
- Update task status (Accepted → In Progress → Completed)
- Log delivered resources

### 3) Responder (Police/Army/Red Cross)
- Verify citizen reports
- Set urgency level (Low → Critical)
- Create and assign tasks to volunteers
- Close resolved incidents

### 4) Admin
- Manage users and roles
- Monitor false reporting
- View analytics dashboard
- Maintain activity logs (audit trail)

---

## 🧠 Core Features (What Makes It Stand Out)

### 🗺️ 1) Live Incident Map
- All incidents appear on an interactive map
- Pins are color-coded by:
  - Disaster type
  - Urgency
  - Verification status
- Filters for searching incidents by district/type/status

**Tech:** Leaflet or Mapbox + MongoDB GeoJSON queries

---

### ⚡ 2) Real-Time Updates (Socket.IO)
All users receive live updates when:
- A new incident is reported
- A report is verified
- A task is assigned or accepted
- Incident/task status changes

This makes the platform feel like a real emergency coordination system.

---

### 🧾 3) Verification Workflow (Anti-Fake Report System)
Reports follow a strict lifecycle:

**Citizen submits → Pending → Verified → Active → Closed**

Only responders can verify incidents.

This prevents false reports from instantly becoming public emergencies.

---

### 📦 4) Resource Request + Tracking
Each incident can request resources such as:
- Food packets
- Blankets
- Medicines
- Shelter support
- Rescue vehicles
- Blood group requests

Volunteers/responders can update:
- available resources
- delivered resources
- shortage status

---

### 🚑 5) Task Assignment System
Responders can create tasks under an incident, for example:
- “Deliver medical kit to Ward 8”
- “Evacuate family of 5”
- “Clear road debris”

Volunteers can accept tasks, and the system tracks task progress.

---

### 🔔 6) Notifications
- In-app notifications
- Optional email notifications
- Optional SMS integration (future upgrade)

---

### 📊 7) Analytics Dashboard (Admin/Responder)
Charts and insights such as:
- incidents per district
- average response time
- active volunteers count
- top disaster types
- resource shortage zones

**Tech:** Recharts (React)

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- React Query (API state management)
- Leaflet / Mapbox (map visualization)
- Recharts (dashboard charts)

### Backend
- Node.js + Express.js
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- Socket.IO (real-time communication)
- JWT Authentication + Refresh Tokens
- Zod / Joi validation

### Cloud + Deployment
- MongoDB Atlas (database)
- Cloudinary (media uploads)
- Vercel (frontend hosting)
- Render (backend hosting)

---

## 🧱 Database Design (MongoDB Collections)

### `User`
- name
- email
- passwordHash
- role: citizen | volunteer | responder | admin
- district
- phone
- trustScore (for fake report control)
- createdAt

---

### `Incident`
- title
- type (flood | landslide | fire | earthquake | road_block)
- description
- location (GeoJSON Point)
- district
- status (pending | verified | active | closed)
- urgency (low | medium | high | critical)
- reportedBy (User ID)
- verifiedBy (Responder ID)
- mediaUrls []
- createdAt, updatedAt

---

### `Task`
- incidentId
- createdBy (Responder ID)
- assignedTo (Volunteer ID)
- title
- notes
- status (open | accepted | in_progress | completed)
- geoLocation
- timestamps

---

### `ResourceRequest`
- incidentId
- requestedItems [{ itemName, qty, unit }]
- fulfilledItems [{ itemName, qty }]
- status

---

### `ActivityLog`
- actorId
- actionType
- targetId
- timestamp
- metadata

---

## 🧠 Advanced / Optional Features (For Extra WOW)

### ✅ Offline-First Reporting (PWA)
Allows citizens to:
- submit reports while offline
- auto-sync when network returns

---

### ✅ Duplicate Incident Detection
If multiple reports appear within a short distance (ex: 200m) and same type:
- system flags as possible duplicate
- responder can merge reports

---

### ✅ Credibility / Trust Score
Users with repeated false reports:
- lose trust score
- their future reports require extra verification
- may be blocked by admin

---

### ✅ Heatmap Layer
Shows disaster density by region.

---

## 👥 Recommended Group Division

### Member 1: Backend + Auth + RBAC
- JWT + refresh tokens
- role middleware
- user management

### Member 2: Incidents + Map System
- incident CRUD
- geo queries
- map UI + filters

### Member 3: Tasks + Socket.IO + Notifications
- real-time events
- task assignment logic
- notification system

### Member 4: Admin Dashboard + Analytics
- charts + dashboard UI
- activity logs
- moderation tools

---

## 🎥 Demo Flow (Best Way to Present)
1. Citizen reports an incident with location + image  
2. Responder verifies it and sets urgency  
3. Map updates live for all users  
4. Responder creates a relief task  
5. Volunteer accepts the task  
6. Volunteer updates progress → completed  
7. Admin dashboard shows analytics  

---

## 🌍 Nepal-Specific Scenarios Supported
- Landslides (Sindhupalchok, Myagdi, Mustang road sections)
- Floods (Terai belt: Koshi, Narayani, Karnali)
- Earthquake aftershock damage reporting
- Road blockage reporting in hilly highways
- Emergency shelter and medical coordination

---

## 💡 Other Ideas Mentioned in Class

- teachers upload short lessons
- students learn in small chunks
- quizzes + progress tracking

---

### 2) Hospital Social App (Started)

---

### 3) Landslide Alert System (Idea)
A system for:
- landslide risk reporting
- alerts
- map-based risk visualization

---
