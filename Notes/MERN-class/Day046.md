# MERN Class Notes

**Date:** 29 Jan 2026, Thursday  
**Topic:** Introduction to Redux & Global State Management

---

### Redux History
- Created by **Dan Abramov** from the React team (Facebook).  
- Official documentation: [redux.js.org](https://redux.js.org)  

---

### Redux Intro
- A **global state management tool**.  
- Not as popular in every community, but very **important for job-ready skills**.  
- **Vanilla Redux** is not very beginner-friendly.  
- Recommended: follow tutorials / quick start guides.  
- Redux setup is **located outside app components**.  

---

### Next.js
- Framework by **Vercel**.  
- Works well with Redux for full-stack React apps.  

---

### What is Flux?
- Architectural pattern created by **Facebook**.  
- Redux is inspired by Flux principles (unidirectional data flow).  

---

### Getting Started with Redux
- Place Redux setup in a dedicated part inside `src` (alongside `public`, `node_modules`).  
- Don’t forget to add a `.env` file for environment variables if needed.

### Sir’s Notes: Task
**Goal:** Learn about Redux / global state management  

---

#### 1. What is Redux?
- A **library to maintain global states** (predictable).  
- Stores and manages data in **one central place**.  
- Helps **avoid props drilling** (passing props through many layers).  
- Any component can access this data globally.  

---

#### 2. Alternatives to Redux
- **Zustand**  
- **Context API**  
- **MobX**  
- **Recoil**  

---

#### 3. Global State vs Component-Level State
- **Global State:** accessible by any component in the app.  
- **Component-Level State:** created with `useState`, accessible **only within that component**.  

---

#### 4. Store, Actions, Action Types, and Dispatching Actions
- **Store:** centralized space to hold global states.  
- **Action:** a task to execute (e.g., change counter value).  
- **Action Type:** specifies what kind of action to execute (e.g., `increment`, `decrement`).  
- **Dispatching:** sending the action to the Redux store so it can update the state.
