# MERN Class Notes  
**Date:** 19 Jan 2026 (Monday)

---

## AI & CV Screening
- AI screeners are increasingly used for **CV filtering and optimization**
- Focus: better structuring, keyword alignment, and clarity

### Tools Mentioned
- **Lovable**
- **Bolt**
- **v0**

> These tools help in creating **AI-generated web components and sites** efficiently.

---

## Client–Server Communication Basics
- Usually, the **client initiates** the conversation with the server
- Traditional request–response model

---

## WebSocket
- Enables **two-way (bidirectional)** communication between client and server
- Both server and client can **send and receive** messages anytime
- Supports **multiple clients** connected to the same server

### Use Cases
- Chat applications
- TV / live broadcast systems
- Share market / real-time price updates

> WebSocket can technically handle SSE-like tasks,  
> but it can become **messy for simple one-way data streams**.

---

## SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- **Server initiates** the communication
- One-way data flow: server → client
- Simpler than WebSocket for streaming updates

---

## Learning & Reference Resources
- **roadmap.sh** — structured learning paths
- **sharehubnepal.com**
  - Outquest
  - Example use-case of **SSE**

---

## Summary Insight
- Use **WebSocket** when interaction is two-way and dynamic  
- Use **SSE** when the server only needs to push updates  
- Choose tools based on **complexity vs clarity**, not hype

## Presentation on MCP for next class:

# MCP (Model Context Protocol) - Simple Explanation

## What is MCP?

MCP is like a **universal translator** that helps AI agents talk to different applications and services[1]. Think of it as "USB-C for AI" - just like USB-C works with any device, MCP lets AI work with any application using one standard language[3].

## Why Do We Need MCP?

**The Problem:** Every airline, hotel, or service has different ways (APIs) to access their data. One uses `/api/flights`, another uses `/flights-list`, and they all return information in different formats. Writing code to connect to each one individually is tedious and time-consuming.

**The Solution:** MCP provides a standard guide that tells AI agents:
- What capabilities each service has (like "search flights" or "book hotel")
- What information format to send
- What information format to expect back

This means you don't need to write custom code for every single service anymore - the AI can figure it out using MCP[1].

## How MCP Works (Simple Version)

1. **MCP Server** - Sits between the AI agent and the actual service (like an airline website)
2. **MCP Client** - Built into the AI agent, reads the MCP instructions
3. **Configuration File** - A simple file (like `mcp.json`) that tells your AI agent which MCP servers are available

Instead of your AI agent talking directly to 100 different airlines in 100 different ways, it talks to MCP servers using ONE standard way[1].

## Real-World Example: PowerPoint MCP Server

The PowerPoint MCP Server lets AI create and edit PowerPoint presentations automatically[1][6]. You can simply tell Claude Desktop: "Create a 10-slide presentation about Q3 marketing results" and it will:
- Create the slides
- Add content
- Format professionally
- Insert charts and images
- All without you opening PowerPoint[7]

The MCP server has **32 different tools** organized into categories like:
- Creating presentations
- Adding slides and content
- Applying professional designs
- Inserting images and charts
- Managing templates[1]

## Key Benefits

✅ **One Standard for Everything** - AI agents can connect to any service that has an MCP server
✅ **No Custom Coding** - Just point your AI to the MCP server configuration
✅ **Works Across Platforms** - Windows, macOS, Linux all supported[3]
✅ **Open Source** - Created by Anthropic (makers of Claude) and now used by everyone[1]

## Bottom Line

MCP makes it possible for AI agents to actually **do things** (book flights, create presentations, access databases) instead of just **talking about things**. It's the missing piece that turns chatbots into useful AI assistants that can take real actions on your behalf.

# 🐒 MCP Architecture Explained (Monkey-to-Monkey Edition)

Because sometimes the clearest systems are explained by confused monkeys and bananas.

---

## 🍌 The Original Desire

### 🐵 User / UI / App
**"uhh uhh aah ahh me want banana"**

- Expresses **desire**, not method
- No idea where bananas come from
- No permissions, no logic
- Just hunger and vibes

> This is raw **intent**.

---

## 🛂 Permission & Authority Layer

### 🐵 MCP Host  
**"uh uh ah ah ok me picks the tools needed to get banana"**

What this monkey actually does:
- Checks rules:
  - Am I allowed to get bananas?
  - Which banana trees are approved?
  - Is this monkey trusted?
- Decides:
  - ✅ Yes → use banana-picking tool
  - ❌ No → go hungry

Important:
- Does **NOT** climb trees
- Does **NOT** carry bananas
- Only decides **what is allowed**

> This is the **gatekeeper monkey**.

---

## 📦 Communication Layer

### 🐵 MCP Client  
**"uh uh ah ah me carry banana request to banana picker"**

What this monkey does:
- Takes the Host’s approved request
- Walks it to the correct monkey
- Uses a strict protocol
- Says nothing else

What it does NOT do:
- No decision-making
- No permissions
- No logic

> This monkey has **legs, not a brain**.

---

## 🛠️ Execution Layer

### 🐵 MCP Server  
**"uh uh ah ah me climb tree and get banana using tools"**

This monkey:
- Knows how banana trees work
- Has tools:
  - Ladder
  - Knife
  - Basket
- Handles logic:
  - Which tree?
  - How many bananas?
  - What if tree is empty?

This is where:
- Real work happens
- Errors occur
- Business logic lives

> If something breaks, it’s this monkey’s fault.

---

## 🏦 Source of Truth

### 🐵 Database / API  
**"uh uh ah ah me only store bananas, take only what allowed"**

This monkey:
- Stores bananas
- Counts bananas
- Guards bananas
- Does NOT care why you want them

Characteristics:
- Dumb
- Honest
- Reliable
- Zero empathy

> Databases don’t hallucinate.  
> They just answer what you actually asked.

---

## 🔁 Full Banana Flow

1. 🐵 User wants banana  
2. 🐵 Host checks permission and tools  
3. 🐵 Client carries request  
4. 🐵 Server climbs tree and gets banana  
5. 🐵 Database confirms banana exists  
6. Banana travels back up the chain  
7. User eats 🍌

---

## ⚠️ Monkey Wisdom (Very Important)

- If 🐵 User talks directly to 🐵 Database  
  → **banana apocalypse**
- If 🐵 Host is removed  
  → **unauthorized bananas everywhere**
- If 🐵 Client starts thinking  
  → **bad architecture**

---

## 🧠 Final Truth

> **Strong systems are just well-trained monkeys who know their job and stay in their lane.**

Old wisdom.  
New acronyms.  
Same jungle.

🍌
