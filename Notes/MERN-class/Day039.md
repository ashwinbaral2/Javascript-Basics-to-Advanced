## AI & CV Screening
- AI screeners are increasingly used for **CV filtering and optimization**
- Focus: better structuring, keyword alignment, and clarity

### Tools Mentioned
- **Lovable**
- **Bolt**
- **v0**

> These tools help in creating **AI-generated web components and sites** efficiently.

---

## Client–Server Communication Basics
- Usually, the **client initiates** the conversation with the server
- Traditional request–response model

---

## WebSocket
- Enables **two-way (bidirectional)** communication between client and server
- Both server and client can **send and receive** messages anytime
- Supports **multiple clients** connected to the same server

### Use Cases
- Chat applications
- TV / live broadcast systems
- Share market / real-time price updates

> WebSocket can technically handle SSE-like tasks,  
> but it can become **messy for simple one-way data streams**.

---

## SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- **Server initiates** the communication
- One-way data flow: server → client
- Simpler than WebSocket for streaming updates

---

## Learning & Reference Resources
- **roadmap.sh** — structured learning paths
- **sharehubnepal.com**
  - Outquest
  - Example use-case of **SSE**

---

## Summary Insight
- Use **WebSocket** when interaction is two-way and dynamic  
- Use **SSE** when the server only needs to push updates  
- Choose tools based on **complexity vs clarity**, not hype
