## Big Picture: Interviews in 2026

* Modern interviews focus **more on concepts and problem‑solving** than memorizing syntax.
* Syntax can be Googled or generated by AI; **thinking cannot**.
* Emphasis areas:

  * **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** over framework basics
  * **Brainstorming & logical puzzles** to test clarity of thought
  * Ability to **explain trade‑offs** and reasoning

> Old-school analogy: just like early‑2000s *Miniclip flash games* trained reflexes, puzzles train mental agility.

### Common Interview Pattern

* Warm‑up: basic CS + project discussion
* Core round:

  * DSA problems
  * Puzzle / aptitude questions
  * System or backend design (even at junior level)

## Using AI as an Agent (Not a Crutch)

Tools like **Cursor**, **Sonnet**, **Gemini Pro** can be used as *agents* to:

* Scaffold projects
* Generate boilerplate
* Speed up documentation

Key idea: *You still must understand and verify everything generated.*

### Example Prompt Used (Kept As‑Is)

```
create nodejs express project backend with sqlite db which has all necessary endpoints for ecommerce for products CRUD, user cart CRUD, user register/login, product CRUD, orders and give me back documentation in readme for how to start

and for every order, reward point with proper logic...saved for every user and give json payload for each post api and also update the readme

rider panel to fulfill order
```

### What This Prompt Covers Conceptually

* **Backend framework:** Node.js + Express
* **Database:** SQLite (lightweight, file‑based)
* **Core features:**

  * User authentication (register / login)
  * Product CRUD
  * Cart CRUD
  * Orders
  * Reward points system per order
  * Rider / delivery panel
* **Developer experience:**

  * README documentation
  * API payload examples

---

## Authentication vs Authorization (Very Important)

* **Authentication:** *Who are you?*

  * Login / Register
  * JWT generation
* **Authorization:** *What are you allowed to do?*

  * Role‑based access (user, admin, rider)
  * Protected routes

### Tokens

* **Bearer Token (JWT)**
* Sent via headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

* Can be tested using **Thunder Client** or **Postman**

---

## Environment Variables

* Sensitive values must go into `.env`
* Frontend (Next.js) variables must be prefixed:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_*
```

### Example Usage

```js
await axios.get(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL)
```

Never hardcode secrets in the source code.

---

## APIs & Communication (Conceptual Recap)

* **REST API**

  * Request–response model
  * Stateless
  * Connection closes after response

* **WebSocket**

  * Persistent connection
  * Real‑time updates

* **SSE (Server‑Sent Events)**

  * One‑way: server → client
  * Example: online status, notifications

---

## Takeaways

* Interviews reward **clarity of thought**, not fancy stacks.
* AI tools are accelerators, not replacements.
* Always be able to answer:

  * *Why did you choose this?*
  * *What breaks if scale increases?*
* Master fundamentals → frameworks become easy.

**Personal Note:**
Understanding concepts deeply now saves embarrassment later in interviews.
