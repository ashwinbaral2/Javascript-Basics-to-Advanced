## 🟠 1️⃣ CORE CONCEPT: EVERYTHING IS AN OBJECT

**📌 KEY UNDERSTANDING:**

In JavaScript, **everything is an object**:

- Functions are objects
- Arrays are objects
- Primitives have object wrappers
- All operations eventually run on prototype links

**📌 IMPORTANT:**

- Objects are connected through **prototype links**
- These links are **not directly visible**
- Understanding this is essential for mastering JavaScript

## 🟠 2️⃣ DEBUGGING & EXECUTION UNDERSTANDING

**📌 HOW TO LEARN EXECUTION:**

- Use the **browser console** while explaining in interviews
- Use the **debugger** to check how functions run
- Step through code to see exactly what happens during execution
- Watch variables change in real-time

**💡 WHY THIS MATTERS:**

Understanding code execution helps you:
- Debug issues faster
- Explain code behavior confidently
- Anticipate side effects
