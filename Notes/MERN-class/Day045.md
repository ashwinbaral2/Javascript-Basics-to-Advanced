# MERN Class Notes

**Date:** 28 Jan 2026 -  Wednesday
**Topic:** Project Ideas, WebSockets, Redux / Global State Management

## Brainstormed Project Ideas

### 1. Bill Splitting App (Dribbble‑inspired UI)

* Clean, minimal UI inspired by Dribbble shots
* Features:

  * Create groups
  * Add expenses
  * Auto split (equal / custom)
  * Balance settlement
* Tech thoughts:

  * Frontend: React + Tailwind
  * Backend: Node.js + Express
  * DB: MongoDB

---

### 2. Notification Making App

* Purpose: learn real‑time systems
* Features:

  * Trigger notifications
  * Read / unread status
  * Real‑time updates
* Key learning:

  * WebSockets
  * Event‑driven architecture

---

### 3. AI Workflow Automation (Zapier / n8n.io inspired)

* Drag‑and‑drop workflow builder
* AI triggers and actions
* Learning focus:

  * Automation logic
  * Background jobs
  * API orchestration

> **Prompt idea after design phase:**
> “Start backend” → scaffold APIs, DB schema, auth, background workers

---

### 4. Market Tracker (sharesansar.com/market inspired)

* Live stock / market dashboard
* Features:

  * Live price updates
  * Market indices
  * Historical data
* Ideal use‑case for **WebSockets**

---

## WebSocket Usage (Why & Where)

### Why WebSockets?

* Persistent connection
* Real‑time, bidirectional data flow
* Much better than polling for live data

### Use‑cases:

* Stock prices (market app)
* Notifications
* Live chat
* Order status updates

## Tomorrow’s Task

**Focus:** Redux / Global State Management

> Win condition: *Understand when and why global state is needed — not just syntax.*

---

## Redux & State Management

### 1. What is Redux?

Redux is a **predictable state container** for JavaScript apps.

* Centralizes application state
* Makes state changes explicit and traceable
* Commonly used with React

In short:

> *One global store → controlled updates → predictable UI*

---

### 2. Alternatives to Redux

Redux is powerful but not always necessary.

Common alternatives:

* **React Context API** – small apps, simple state
* **Zustand** – lightweight, minimal boilerplate
* **Recoil** – atom‑based state
* **Jotai** – simpler Recoil‑like approach
* **MobX** – reactive, less strict

> Hot take: *Redux is not hard — bad tutorials make it look hard.*

---

### 3. Global State vs Component‑Level State

#### Component‑Level State

* Local to a component
* Managed using `useState`
* Example:

  * Form input values
  * Toggle buttons

#### Global State

* Shared across multiple components
* Examples:

  * Authenticated user
  * Shopping cart
  * Theme (dark/light)

Rule of thumb:

> *If many unrelated components need it → global state.*

---

### 4. Core Redux Concepts

#### Store

* Single source of truth
* Holds the entire app state

#### Actions

* Plain JavaScript objects
* Describe **what happened**

Example:

```js
{ type: "ADD_TO_CART", payload: product }
```

#### Action Types

* String constants
* Prevent mistakes & improve readability

```js
const ADD_TO_CART = "ADD_TO_CART";
```

#### Dispatch

* Method to send actions to the store

```js
dispatch({ type: ADD_TO_CART, payload: product });
```

#### Reducers (Important glue)

* Pure functions
* Decide **how state changes**

```js
(state, action) => newState
```

> Redux rule: *State is read‑only. You don’t mutate — you replace.*

---

## Mental Model (Remember This)

* UI triggers **action**
* Action is **dispatched**
* Reducer calculates **new state**
* Store updates
* UI re‑renders

Simple. Boring. Powerful.

## Closing Thought

Redux teaches discipline.
You may not need it everywhere — but learning it once sharpens how you think about **state, data flow, and architecture**.

Tomorrow: learn it slow, question everything, and don’t worship tools.
