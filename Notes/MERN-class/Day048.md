## Redux DevTools

* Browser extension to inspect **Redux state**, **actions**, and **time-travel debugging**.
* Helps answer: *what action fired?*, *what changed?*, *why did it break?*
* Essential when global state starts getting messy (and it always does).

---

## Global Search (VS Code)

* **Shortcut:** `Ctrl + Shift + F`
* Searches across the **entire project**, not just the current file.
* Use cases:

  * Find where a function/action is used
  * Track down bugs caused by duplicated logic
  * Refactor safely

---

## `dispatch` in Redux

* `dispatch` is how you **send actions to the Redux store**.

* Flow:

  1. Component calls `dispatch(action)`
  2. Reducer receives action
  3. State updates
  4. UI re-renders

* Think of it as: *"Hey store, something happened."*

---

## Cookies in Websites

* Small pieces of data stored by the browser.
* Automatically sent to the **server** with every request (unless blocked).
* Commonly used for:

  * Authentication
  * Sessions
  * Tracking

---

## Application Tab (DevTools)

* Found alongside **Elements**, **Console**, **Network**, etc.
* Used to inspect:

  * Cookies
  * Local Storage
  * Session Storage
  * IndexedDB
  * Cache & Service Workers

Basically: *where frontend data goes to live and die.*

## Cookies vs Local Storage vs Session Storage

| Feature        | Cookies         | Local Storage | Session Storage |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Max Size       | ~4 KB           | ~10 MB        | ~5 MB           |
| Sent to Server | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No          | ❌ No            |
| Persistence    | Configurable    | Forever       | Tab-only        |
| JS Access      | Optional        | Yes           | Yes             |
| Security       | High (HttpOnly) | Low           | Low             |
| Best Use       | Auth, sessions  | Preferences   | Temporary state |

**Rule of thumb:**

* Auth → Cookies
* UI preferences → Local Storage
* Temporary state → Session Storage

## IndexedDB

| Feature    | IndexedDB         | Local Storage     |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Data type  | Objects, files    | Strings only      |
| Size       | Huge              | Small             |
| Speed      | Fast for big data | Slow for big data |
| Complexity | Higher            | Dead simple       |
| Use case   | Offline apps      | Preferences       |

* Used by serious web apps (offline-first, caching, large datasets).
* Overkill for simple settings — perfect for **real apps**.

---

## Microsoft Clarity

* Tool to analyze **real user behavior** on your website.

* Features:

  * Session replays
  * Heatmaps
  * Scroll tracking
  * Rage clicks

* Useful for improving UX without guessing.

### Closing Note

Frontend is not just UI — it’s **state, storage, and behavior**. The better you understand where data lives and how it flows, the fewer ghosts you’ll be chasing later.
