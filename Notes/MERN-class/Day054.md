# MERN CLASS NOTES — DAY 054

## 📆 Date: **February 11, 2026 (Wednesday)**

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered
- Creating a **README.md** file in proper Markdown format
  - Include project plan
  - Mention libraries + frameworks used
  - Keep README aligned with what the project actually does
- Project inspiration sources:
  - **merolagaani.com** — Nepal stock market reference (for web socket usage)
- Explore UI/design direction for **MedLink**
- Define and lock features for **version 0.1.0** (MVP)

---

## 🧠 Project Focus: QuakeAlert v0.1.0 (MVP)

### Goal
Build a clean, working MVP that feels like:
> “Yep. This is basically a mini-USGS.”

---

# ✅ QuakeAlert v0.1.0 — Must-Have Features

## 🌍 Frontend (Next.js + React + TypeScript)

### 1) Live Earthquake Map (Core Feature)
**Success conditions:**
- Map loads successfully
- Markers plotted from real earthquake data
- Zoom + pan works
- Clicking a marker shows basic info

---

### 2) Earthquake List / Feed
**Success conditions:**
- Sidebar or list shows recent earthquakes
- Sorted by most recent
- Clicking an item highlights and/or zooms to the marker

---

### 3) Basic Filters
Minimum filters:
- Magnitude filter (example: **≥ 2.5**, **≥ 4.5**, **≥ 6.0**)
- Time range:
  - past hour
  - past day
  - past week

---

### 4) Earthquake Details View
Can be implemented as either:
- a modal popup, OR
- a dedicated route like: `/event/[id]`

Must display:
- Magnitude
- Location name
- Depth
- Time
- Coordinates
- USGS link *(optional but nice)*

---

## 🧠 Backend (Node.js + Express)

### 5) API Endpoints for Earthquake Data
Example endpoints:
- `GET /api/earthquakes`
- `GET /api/earthquakes/:id`

---

### 6) USGS Data Fetch + Normalization
**Requirements:**
- Fetch from USGS GeoJSON feed
- Convert into a consistent internal schema
- Make frontend data consumption simple and predictable

---

### 7) Database Storage (MongoDB)
**Requirements:**
- Store fetched earthquakes
- Avoid duplicates *(important!)*
- Keep timestamps clean and query-friendly

---

## 🔄 Real-time-ish Behavior (MVP-friendly)

### 8) Auto Refresh
- Refresh earthquake data every **X minutes** (recommended: 1–5 minutes)
- Update map + list without full page reload

---

## 🧼 Quality / Developer Essentials

### 9) Environment Variables Setup
Must include:
- `.env.example`
- Clean separation of config:
  - DB URI
  - API URL
  - any secrets/keys

---

### 10) README that Matches Reality
README must include:
- How to run backend + client
- What features exist (current version)
- Tech stack
- Project structure (optional but helpful)

---

# ⭐ v0.1.0 Success Criteria (Real Test)
If someone opens the app and says:

> “Yep. This is basically a mini-USGS.”

Then the MVP is successfully shipped.

---

# 🚀 Optional (Huge Flex) for v0.1.0
Not required, but impressive:
- Map legend for magnitude colors
- Marker clustering (for crowded areas)
- Loading skeletons / spinner
- Error UI when API fails
