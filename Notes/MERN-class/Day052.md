## 🧩 Topic: ExpressJS + Mongoose Boilerplate (Backend Starter)

Today was mainly about understanding **ExpressJS**, how it fits into backend development, and how to start a clean backend project using **Express + MongoDB + Mongoose**.

---

## 🧠 ExpressJS — Who & What?

### ✅ ExpressJS
- **Backend framework for Node.js**
- Helps you build:
  - APIs (REST)
  - Backend services
  - Server-side logic
- Handles:
  - Routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Middleware
  - Request/response cycle

---

## 🧠 Framework Comparisons (Context)

| Tech | Type | Notes |
|------|------|------|
| **ExpressJS** | Node backend framework | Simple, flexible, most common |
| **Next.js** | React framework | Open-source, by **Vercel** |
| **Django** | Python backend framework | Batteries included |
| **NestJS** | Node backend framework | Trainer recommends; structured + scalable |

> Trainer said: NestJS is good, but Express is still the easiest + most common starting point.

---

## 🚀 Express + Mongoose Starter (GitHub idea)

We discussed using a starter repo (boilerplate) to avoid rewriting the same setup again and again.

### Typical starter includes:
- Express setup
- MongoDB connection
- Mongoose models
- Routes folder
- Controllers folder
- Basic error handling

---

## 🧑‍💻 Prompt used to generate a backend boilerplate

We practiced writing a prompt like this:

> **Prompt:**
Create me a Node.js Express backend project.  
I want to build an earthquake detection tool backend API.  
The concept: an admin must be able to add detected earthquakes with various information such as:

| Field         | Type      | Description |
|------         |------     |-------------|
| **eventId**   | String    | Unique ID, required |
| **source**    | String    | Reporting agency (USGS, EMSC), required |
| **detectedAt**| Date      | Detection timestamp |
| **location**  | GeoJSON   | `[longitude, latitude]`, enables geo queries |
| **depthKm**   | Number    | Depth in km |
| **magnitude** | Object    | `{ value, scale }` |
| **reviewed**  | Boolean   | Verified by expert (default: false) |
| **remarks**   | String    | Optional notes |
| **timestamps**| Auto      | `createdAt`, `updatedAt` |

Also:
- Admin should be able to check latitude/longitude on a map
- Architecture should be small + easy:
  - models
  - controllers
  - routes
- Use MongoDB + Mongoose

---

## 🌍 Domain Knowledge Needed for Earthquake API Project

We discussed that backend development is not only coding.

To build a realistic project, we need **domain knowledge** like:

### ✅ Earthquake Data Concepts
- What is **magnitude** (Mw, ML, Ms, Mb)?
- What is **depth** and how it affects shaking?
- What is a seismic **event ID**?
- Why latitude/longitude must be stored as GeoJSON?

### ✅ GeoJSON + GIS Concepts
- GeoJSON Point format:
```json
  {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [longitude, latitude]
  }
```

* Why order matters:

  * `longitude` first
  * `latitude` second

### ✅ Real-world API relevance

* Real earthquake catalogs have:

  * event IDs
  * region names
  * magnitude types
  * time zones / UTC
  * review status
  * sources

---

## 🕵️ Reverse Engineering (Best Practice)

A key lesson today:

> **It’s always better if you can do reverse engineering.**

Meaning:

* Check how real earthquake websites structure their data
* Copy the useful fields
* Design your API so it matches real-world standards

This makes your project:

* more realistic
* more professional
* easier to scale
* easier to integrate with real data later

---

## 📚 API Documentation References (Real-world)

We looked at real earthquake data APIs:

### 1) USGS Earthquake Catalog API

* [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/)

### 2) XWeather Earthquake API

* [https://www.xweather.com/docs/weather-api/endpoints/earthquakes](https://www.xweather.com/docs/weather-api/endpoints/earthquakes)

---

## 🏛️ MVC Architecture

We introduced **MVC** structure:

### Model

* Mongoose schema + database logic

### Controller

* Business logic (create, update, delete, validate)

### Routes

* Defines endpoints:

  * GET / POST / PUT / DELETE
  * connects route → controller function

---

## ⏳ Promises, Async & Await

We revised the concept that MongoDB calls are async:

### Why async matters

* DB operations take time
* JavaScript continues running
* We must wait for the result

### Tools we use:

* `Promise`
* `async`
* `await`

Example:

```js
const earthquakes = await Earthquake.find();
```

---

## 📌 Summary of Today

### Today we learned:

* What ExpressJS is
* How it compares to other frameworks
* How to start an Express + Mongoose backend quickly
* Why domain knowledge matters in backend projects
* Reverse engineering real APIs
* MVC structure
* async/await fundamentals

---

## 🔥 Next Steps (Personal)

For the Earthquake backend project:

* Build clean MVC structure
* Implement CRUD with controllers
* Add GeoJSON indexing (`2dsphere`)
* Add filtering:

  * by magnitude
  * by time range
  * by distance (nearby search)
