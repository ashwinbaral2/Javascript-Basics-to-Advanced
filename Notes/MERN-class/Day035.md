## 🧩 Topic: Admin Products Page (E-commerce)

### 🎯 Goal of the Session
Build and manage the **Products Page for Admin**, focusing on UI structure and CRUD logic.

---

## 🛠️ What Was Covered

### 1. Admin Products Page
- Designed a **Products Management page** for the admin panel
- Displayed products in a **table format**
- Prepared the structure for **Add / Edit / Delete** operations

---

### 2. Drawer Component
- Used a **Drawer** (side panel) instead of a full page/modal
- Purpose:
  - Add new products
  - Edit existing products
- Improves UX by keeping the admin on the same page

🕒 **Reference timestamp:** `37:00`

---

### 3. Parent → Child Props Flow
- Passed data and functions from **parent component** to **child component**
- Used for:
  - Opening/closing the drawer
  - Sending selected product data for editing
- Reinforced the concept of **unidirectional data flow in React**

---

### 4. Fake Data / Filler Extension
- Used a **fake filler extension** for:
  - Product names
  - Descriptions
  - Prices
- Helpful for:
  - UI testing
  - Faster prototyping

---

### 5. CRUD Logic (UI Level)
- **Add Product**
  - Insert new product into the table
- **Edit Product**
  - Load product data into the drawer
  - Update product details
- **Delete Product**
  - Remove product entry from the table

> Focus was mainly on **frontend logic and state handling**, not backend persistence yet.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Drawer is a clean alternative to modals for admin workflows
- Parent–child props are essential for component communication
- Fake data speeds up development during early UI stages
- Admin panels are about **clarity, speed, and control**, not fancy UI

---

## 🔜 What This Leads To
- Connecting products page to backend API
- Persisting CRUD actions to the database
- Adding validation and confirmation dialogs
