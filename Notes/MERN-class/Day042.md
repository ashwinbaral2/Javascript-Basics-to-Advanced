# MERN / AI Fundamentals – Class Notes  
**Date:** 23 Jan 2026 (Friday)
**Focus:** AI Concepts + Web Communication Models  

---

## 1. Core AI Terminologies

### LLM (Large Language Model)
A model trained on massive text data to:
- understand language
- generate responses
- reason contextually  

Examples: GPT, Gemini, Claude  
Used for: chatbots, code assistants, summarization, reasoning tools.

---

### Agents
AI **agents** are LLMs + tools + memory + decision logic.

An agent can:
- decide what action to take
- call APIs
- use tools (search, database, code execution)
- act autonomously toward a goal

Think:  
> LLM = brain  
> Agent = brain + hands

---

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
RAG = **LLM + external knowledge source**

Instead of relying only on training data:
1. Query a database / documents
2. Retrieve relevant info
3. Feed it to the LLM
4. Generate a grounded response

Solves:
- hallucination
- outdated knowledge
- domain-specific accuracy

---

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
A protocol to **standardize how LLMs talk to tools, data, and services**.

Purpose:
- structured context sharing
- consistent tool access
- scalable agent systems

In short:
> MCP is the *plumbing* that connects AI brains to the real world.

---

## 2. AI Automation Workflow

### AI Automation (Zapier)
Tools like **zapier.com** allow:
- connecting AI with apps
- automating workflows
- triggering actions without manual coding

Example:
- New email → summarize with AI → store in Notion → notify Slack

AI + automation = force multiplier.

---

## 3. Portpro
**Portpro** is used for:
- finding vacancies
- professional opportunities
- project-to-job mapping

Useful for:
- internships
- dev roles
- early career exposure

---

## 4. Web Communication Models

### REST API
**Request–Response based**

- Client sends request
- Server responds
- Connection closes after data transfer

Characteristics:
- stateless
- simple
- widely used
- not real-time

Example:
> Browser requests user data → server responds → done.

---

### GraphQL
A more flexible alternative to REST.

Client decides:
- what data it wants
- how much data it wants

Advantages:
- avoids over-fetching
- avoids under-fetching
- single endpoint

---

### WebSockets
**Persistent, two-way communication**

- Client and server stay connected
- Both can send data anytime
- Real-time

Used in:
- chat apps
- online games
- live dashboards

---

### SSE (Server-Sent Events)
**One-way real-time communication**

- Server pushes data
- Client does NOT request repeatedly
- Client only listens

Example:
> Discord showing who is online  
Server automatically sends updates without the user asking.

Difference:
- WebSocket → two-way  
- SSE → server → client only

---

## 5. Setup & Sunday Implications
Today focused more on:
- environment setup
- conceptual clarity
- understanding how systems talk to each other

Less coding, more **mental framework building** — necessary before scaling complexity.

---

## Key Takeaway
Modern development is no longer just about writing code.

It’s about:
- systems
- protocols
- automation
- AI integration
- real-time communication

Understanding these concepts early saves years of confusion later.
