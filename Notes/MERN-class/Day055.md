# MERN CLASS NOTES — DAY 055

## 📆 Date: **February 12, 2026 (Thursday)**

---

## 1) Project Discussion (Launch Mindset)

Today’s focus was less “coding” and more **thinking like a real product builder**.

When you make a project for launch, you’re not just building features — you’re building something that:

* has users
* solves a real problem
* can attract investors
* can scale later

---

## 2) Login / Register Page Assignment

### 🎯 Task

Build a clean **Register + Login system** as part of your MERN project.

This is one of the most important base modules of any real-world web app.

## 3) Launching a Project = User Survey First

Before launching a project, you should create a **user survey** to understand what users actually want.

### Why survey matters

| Reason               | Explanation                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Saves time           | You don’t build useless features  |
| Saves money          | Investors don’t fund random ideas |
| Makes product better | You target real pain points       |
| Gives direction      | Your roadmap becomes clear        |

## 4) Survey Rules (Important)

Your survey must be:

### ✅ Precise

* No unnecessary questions
* Straight to the point

### ✅ Generalized

* Don’t make it too niche
* Target the actual userbase, not your friends only

### ✅ Feature-Focused

* Ask what people *need*
* Ask what would make them use the app daily

## 5) Investors + Launch Reality

When a project is built for launch:

* It can be **financed by investors**
* If the project is strong and presentable, you can submit it to:

  * startup programs
  * incubators
  * competitions
  * investor pitching platforms
    *(teacher hinted at this part)*

## 6) Key Takeaway (Real Talk 😤)

> Most student projects fail because they are built like assignments.
> Real projects are built like products.
