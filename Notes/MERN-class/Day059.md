## 🗺️ Project Discussion: Dashboard + Maps

### Dashboard & Maps
- Discussed more about the **dashboard** and **map integration** in the project.
- Map features are a major part of the hospital social / emergency platform.
- Trainer highlighted how the dashboard should visually support:
  - emergencies near the user,
  - fundraising requests,
  - category-based emergency cards,
  - map + list UI patterns.

### Fundraiser Page
- Talked about a **fundraiser page** as part of the project.
- Fundraiser requests are part of emergency/social support features.

---

## 🎨 UI/UX: Dashboard Design & Style

- Chose a design direction and styling approach for the dashboard.
- Focus was on making it:
  - clean,
  - modern,
  - easy to scan quickly (important for emergencies),
  - mobile-friendly.

---

## ✅ Task Assigned to Me
### Navbar for Hospital Social App
- My task: build a **navbar** for the hospital social / emergency platform.
- Navbar should support:
  - main navigation (home, dashboard, map),
  - auth links (login/register),
  - profile menu (settings/logout),
  - emergency categories,
  - responsive design (mobile hamburger).

---

## 🗺️ Map Reference / Inspiration
- **map.gallimap.com** was referenced as an example.
- Goal: include a map experience with:
  - strong UI,
  - clear navigation controls,
  - map-focused layout patterns.

## 🧠 Updated Navbar (Enhanced with Map Features)


I am building a medical emergency + hospital social web app called "Medlink". 
The app has these pages already: `/` (home), `/login`, `/register`, `/dashboard`, and a map page (example: `/map`).

I want you to generate a responsive, modern navbar component for Next.js + TailwindCSS.

The navbar must include:
---
### 1) Logo Section
- Top-left logo placeholder (Medlink).
- Clicking it routes to `/`.
- Logo should stay visible on desktop and mobile.

### 2) Primary Links (Desktop)
- Home → `/`
- Dashboard → `/dashboard`
- Map → `/map`
- Fundraiser → `/fundraiser` (or placeholder link)

### 3) Emergency Categories Dropdown
- A dropdown labeled "Emergencies" with category links:
  - Blood Donation
  - Ambulance Request
  - Organ Donor Needed
  - ICU Bed Availability
  - Emergency Funding
  - General Medical Emergency
- Each category should route to a clean URL like:
  `/emergencies/blood`, `/emergencies/ambulance`, etc.

### 4) Map-focused Controls (Inspired by map.gallimap.com)
- The navbar should be designed so it works nicely on map pages:
  - keep height compact,
  - avoid covering too much map space,
  - allow a clean top bar layout.
- Add a small "Map View" toggle button placeholder (future feature):
  - Street
  - Satellite
  - Terrain
- Add a placeholder for "Nearby" filter on the map:
  - dropdown for radius (1km, 5km, 10km, 25km)

### 5) Authentication / User Menu
- If user is NOT logged in:
  - show Login and Register buttons.
- If user IS logged in:
  - show an avatar circle and a dropdown menu:
    - Profile
    - Settings
    - Logout

### 6) Notifications (Future-ready)
- Add a bell icon placeholder with a badge count.
- This will later show emergency alerts near the user.

### 7) Responsiveness
- Must collapse into hamburger menu on mobile.
- Mobile menu must include:
  - Home, Dashboard, Map, Fundraiser
  - Emergency categories list
  - Login/Register or Profile dropdown

### 8) Styling
- TailwindCSS only.
- Modern medical look:
  - clean spacing,
  - rounded buttons,
  - subtle shadow,
  - clear hover states.
- Use a sticky navbar (fixed at top) so it stays visible while scrolling.

### 9) Implementation Requirements
- Use functional React component.
- Use `next/link` for navigation.
- Must be ready to drop into `/components/Navbar.jsx`.
- Add comments for where to connect real auth state, notifications, and map filters later.

Output: provide the complete code for `Navbar.jsx`.

## 🔥 Notes / Next Steps
- After navbar is done, it should be integrated into:
  - the dashboard layout,
  - map layout,
  - auth pages (login/register).
- Later improvements:
  - real notification count from backend,
  - location permission UI,
  - emergency category color badges.
