## 1. What is REST?

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style built around **resources** and **HTTP verbs**.

You interact with **multiple endpoints**, each representing a resource.

### Example
```http
GET /users/1
GET /users/1/posts
GET /posts/5/comments
```


| Feature        | REST              | GraphQL             |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Endpoints      | Many              | Single              |
| Data shape     | Fixed             | Client-defined      |
| Over-fetching  | Common            | Rare                |
| Under-fetching | Common            | Rare                |
| HTTP caching   | Easy              | Difficult           |
| Learning curve | Gentle            | Steep               |
| Tooling        | Minimal           | Heavy               |
| Debugging      | Straightforward   | Can be complex      |
| Best for       | CRUD, simple APIs | Complex data graphs |
| method         | Get,post,patch,del| queries and mutation|
