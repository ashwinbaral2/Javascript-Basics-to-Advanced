## ⚛️ MERN & React Notes

---

## 1. Components

### Component Structure
- **Parent Component**
- **Child Component**
- Together they form the **DOM structure**

> React UI is a tree. Parents give birth, children behave (or don’t).

---

## 2. Passing Data — `callChild` Function

### Concept
- Used to pass data **from Child → Parent**
- Achieved by:
  - Passing a function from parent to child
  - Calling that function inside the child

### Important Notes
- Overusing this pattern can:
  - Complicate logic
  - Make components tightly coupled
- React follows **unidirectional data flow**
  - Data flows **top → down**
  - Child → Parent communication is indirect

> If data flow feels like a maze, you’re probably forcing React to behave like vanilla JS.

## 3. Interview Concepts

### Props Drilling
- Passing props from:
  - Parent → Child → Grandchild → … repeatedly
- Leads to:
  - Messy code
  - Hard-to-maintain components

### Best Practice
- Avoid using props repeatedly for:
  - Sharing **database data**
  - Global application state

> Props drilling works… until it doesn’t. That’s when Context or state managers walk in.

---

## 4. JSX & Dynamic Values

### JSX Dynamic Syntax
- Dynamic values are written using `{}`

```jsx
<h1>{username}</h1>
```

### Purpose

* Converts UI from:

  * ❌ Static
  * ✅ Dynamic

> JSX without `{}` is just fancy HTML wearing a JavaScript costume.

---

## 5. React Component Creation

# Basic Steps

1. Create a function or class
2. Return JSX
3. Export the component
4. Import and use it inside another component

```jsx
function Header() {
  return <header>Header</header>
}

export default Header
```

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

* Components form a **hierarchical DOM tree**
* Data flow is **one-directional**
* Child → Parent communication uses callback functions
* Props drilling is an interview favorite (and a design smell)
* JSX allows dynamic UI using `{}`
