## 📌 Session Overview

A very important hands-on session focused on strengthening **React + TypeScript (TSX)** fundamentals through small projects and better debugging practices.

---

## 🎯 What I Learned Today

### 📝 Quiz App (React + TSX)

* Learned how to build a **Quiz App** using React.
* Used **`.map()`** to loop through questions and options efficiently in **TSX**.
* Understood how mapping helps in rendering dynamic UI components.

```tsx
{questions.map((q, index) => (
  <div key={index}>
    <h3>{q.question}</h3>
    {q.options.map((opt, i) => (
      <button key={i}>{opt}</button>
    ))}
  </div>
))}
```

### 🧪 Debugging & Inspecting Code 🐞

* Practiced using **browser debuggers** during inspection.
* Learned how to:

  * Track state changes
  * Inspect DOM elements
  * Debug logical and rendering issues
* Realized how powerful debugging tools are for real-world development.

---

### 🧮 Mini Projects Practiced

#### ➕ Calculator App

* Implemented basic arithmetic operations.
* Improved understanding of state handling and event-driven logic.

#### ✅ To-Do List App

* Created a simple **To-Do List** using React.
* Practiced adding, listing, and managing tasks.

---

### 🎯 Understanding `e.target.value`

* Learned how to capture user input from form elements.

```tsx
const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  setValue(e.target.value)
}
```

* Used it in inputs for calculator and to-do apps.

---

## 🗂️ Tasks & Follow-ups

* 📄 Copy **React pages and notes** provided by the trainer.
* 🔁 Revise today’s concepts and implementations.

---

## 🚀 Ideas to Try Next

* 🎬 Movie Booking App
* 📦 Inventory Management System
* 🛒 E-commerce Application

These ideas will help apply React concepts in **real-world use cases**.
