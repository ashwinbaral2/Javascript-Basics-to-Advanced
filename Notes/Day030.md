## 🎯 Overview

Today was focused on exploring project ideas, setting up foundations, and surveying the UI and visualization ecosystem. Not everything was built, but a lot was *mapped*, and mapping matters.

---

## 🎡 Mini Project Started

### Spinner Wheel of Fortune
- Initiated a **Spinner / Wheel of Fortune** mini project  
- Goal: build an interactive, logic-driven UI component  
- Useful for:
  - State management practice
  - Animations
  - Randomization logic

Small project, high learning density. Good choice.

## 📦 Projects Submitted

### 🛒 Plazi Fake Store
- Submitted **Plazi Fake Store** project  
- Domain: **E-commerce**
- Focus areas:
  - Product listing
  - UI flow
  - Basic frontend logic

Submission done. Ship it, don’t babysit it.

## 🗂️ Repository & Setup Work

### New Repository Creation
- Created a **new GitHub repository** for upcoming work

### Framework Setup
- Installed **Next.js**
  - Chosen for:
    - Modern React workflow
    - Routing out of the box
    - Better scalability than plain React

Solid foundation. Industry-aligned.

## 🎨 UI & Component Library Exploration

### Hero UI
- Explored **Hero UI**
- Looked into available components and design system

### shadcn/ui
- Considered **shadcn/ui**
- Notes:
  - Very popular
  - Clean, composable components
  - Developer-first approach
- Strong contender for main UI stack

### Bootstrap — The GOAT? 🐐
- Reflected on **Bootstrap**
- Verdict:
  - Still the GOAT for speed and familiarity
  - But less flexible and “modern-feeling” compared to newer libraries

Old king. Still respected.

---

## 📊 Visualization & Fancy Stuff

### D3.js
- Checked **d3js.org**
- Potential use cases:
  - Data visualization
  - Charts
  - Interactive graphs
- Powerful but mentally demanding (worth it).

### Aceternity UI ✨
- Explored **Aceternity UI**
- Purpose:
  - Add visual flair
  - Make interfaces feel modern and polished
- Use sparingly—style should serve function, not replace it.
