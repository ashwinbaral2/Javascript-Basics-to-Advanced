## **10 Must-Haves to Get Hired as a Full-Stack Developer**

### **1. Strong JavaScript Fundamentals**

* You know ES6+, closures, scope, async/await, array & object methods.
* Employers can tell instantly if your JS logic is solid.

---

### **2. React (or another front-end framework)**

* Building interactive, scalable front-ends is expected.
* Know **hooks, props, state, conditional rendering, routing, forms**.

---

* Knowing **how to design, query, and optimize** is crucial.

---

### **5. Version Control (Git)**

* Employers expect you to **push, pull, branch, merge** confidently.
* Open-source contributions or GitHub portfolio → huge plus.

---

### **6. Problem-Solving + DSA**

* Strong algorithm & data structure knowledge is often tested in interviews.
* Even for web dev, logic skills show you can handle complex features efficiently.

---

### **7. Project Portfolio**

* A few **real, deployable projects** that show front-end + back-end + database integration.
* Example: Todo app, e-commerce site, blog platform, chat app.
* Bonus if **live demo links** exist.

---

### **8. Testing & Debugging**

* Ability to write **unit tests** (Jest, Mocha) or debug efficiently.
* Employers love devs who write code that won’t break in production.

---

### **9. Deployment & DevOps Basics**

* Know **how to deploy apps** on Netlify, Vercel, Heroku, or AWS.
* Understanding CI/CD pipelines, Docker, or basic cloud concepts → very attractive.

---

### **10. Soft Skills + Communication**

* Ability to **write clean, readable code**.
* Can explain your logic to non-developers.
* Teamwork, problem-solving attitude, and **ability to learn fast**.
