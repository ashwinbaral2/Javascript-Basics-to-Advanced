functions are ineffective --- value sits in the global variable value.

//anonymous functions
//IIFE
//pure and impure functions

unit testing ---- testing done by devs
- write code in isolation seperately for existing code

//jest functions 

//Interview qn --> TDD *test-driven-development*
write pure function as much as possible but in real world 
application, outer data base has to be used so it becomes 
impure function
