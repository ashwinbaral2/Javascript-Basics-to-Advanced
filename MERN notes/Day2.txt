    ==============================================
    
1. Google Interview Questions

Heavy on problem-solving, system design, algorithms.

Clear thinking + structured approach matters more than fancy code.

2. Competitive Coding

Sharpens logic, speed, and pattern-recognition.

Useful for interviews but not mandatory for normal dev jobs.

3. Pseudocode

Very important in interviews.

Helps explain logic before coding; shows clear reasoning.

4. Tech Debt

“Unfinished” or messy code that slows future development.

Happens when shortcuts are taken.

Reducing tech debt = better long-term project health.

5. DSA Importance

Essential to know fundamentals.

Not heavily asked in lower-level roles, but still useful for writing clean logic.

6. Deep Cloning in JavaScript

Used to fully copy nested objects/arrays without linking to original.

Methods: structuredClone(obj), JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)), or custom recursion.
