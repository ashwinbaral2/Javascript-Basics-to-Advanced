for, while, do while ===> loops 
var vs let vs const 


doing for loop,
	declare -- initialize -- iteration 
	dev must know for loop but dont use it more often because of its tedious nature.
	use map(), forEach() and filter() instead.

these features are slower than for loop
.reduce()
.find()
.findIndex()
.fill()---> more features like maps and filter.
