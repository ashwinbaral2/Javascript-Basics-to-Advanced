### ==== Day 025: MERN & React Notes ====
---

## useState() Hook

* A **React Hook** used to manage state inside functional components.
* State = data that **changes over time** and affects UI rendering.
* When state updates, **React re-renders the UI** automatically.
* Helps keep UI and data in sync without manually touching the DOM.

> Think of hooks as **batteries**: they power heavy lifting like UI updates so you don’t have to.

---

## Hooks (Big Picture)

* Hooks let functional components do things that were once class-only.
* Examples: state, side effects, context, refs.
* They **simplify logic reuse** and keep components cleaner.
* Heavy tasks like UI updates and lifecycle handling are abstracted away.

---

## lucide-react

* A modern **icon library for React**.
* Lightweight, tree-shakeable, and clean SVG icons.
* Needs exploration:

  * How to install
  * How to import icons
  * How to use icons as JSX components

Example usage idea:

* Import icon as a component
* Use it directly inside JSX like a tag

---

## Importing & Using Components as Tags

* React components can be used like **custom HTML tags**.
* Must:

  * Export the component
  * Import it where needed
* Component names must start with **capital letters**.

This enables:

* Reusable UI blocks
* Clean and readable JSX

---

## JavaScript Coding Principles (To Check Online)

* Write **readable** code before clever code
* Prefer **immutability**
* Keep functions **small and single-purpose**
* Avoid unnecessary side effects
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Follow consistency over personal style

---

## Template Literals

* Uses backticks: `` `text` ``
* Allows:

  * String interpolation
  * Multi-line strings

Useful for:

* Dynamic text
* Cleaner concatenation

---

## Game Ideas (Future Practice)

* **Hangman**

  * String logic
  * Conditional rendering
  * User input handling

* **Tic Tac Toe**

  * State management
  * Game logic
  * UI updates based on state

---

## Class Assignment Idea

### Like Button

* Click to toggle like/unlike
* Uses state
* Visual feedback on click
* Simple but powerful React concept

---

## Task: Dice Roller

* Random number generation
* Button click handling
* State-based UI update
* Good practice for:

  * Events
  * State
  * Conditional rendering

---

**Summary:**
Today focused on understanding state, hooks, component usage, and planning practical projects to reinforce React and JavaScript fundamentals.
