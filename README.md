# Javascript-Basics-to-Advanced

A curated, incremental learning repository for JavaScript (and related web technologies). This collection documents core concepts, focused exercises, and small projects arranged so you can review what you've learned, extend topics over time, and share progress with others.

## Overview

This repository is designed as a learning journal and practical reference. It groups short, self-contained examples and practice sets that progress from fundamentals to more advanced topics (arrays, strings, objects, numbers, TypeScript, small Next.js demos, and more).

Use it to: review concepts, run bite-sized examples, add your own lessons, or follow the included mini-projects.

## Quick start

- To run plain JavaScript examples: open a terminal in a folder (for example `JavaScript/array`) and run:

```bash
node level001.js
```

- To run TypeScript examples, compile or use `ts-node` if installed:

```bash
npx ts-node TypeScript/script.ts
```

- To run the Next.js demo located in `my-project`:

```bash
cd my-project
npm install
npm run dev
# then open http://localhost:3000
```

## What you'll find

- Focused topic folders: `JavaScript/array`, `JavaScript/string`, `JavaScript/object`, `JavaScript/number`, `JavaScript/boolean`.
- Practice sets in `JavaScript/Practice-set`.
- TypeScript examples in `TypeScript/`.
- A small Next.js playground in `my-project/` demonstrating practical app structure.
- Notes and daily learning logs in the `Notes/` folder.

## How to use this repo

- Learn: read a short file, run it, then modify it to explore variations.
- Track: use the `Notes/` files to summarize discoveries and links.
- Extend: add files named clearly (e.g., `level014.js`) and update this README to document new sections.

## Project / folder structure (high level)

- `JavaScript/` — core exercises and practice problems.
- `TypeScript/` — typed examples and conversions.
- `my-project/` — Next.js applications and demos.
- `Notes/` — daily notes and learning journal.


## Roadmap & changelog

- Expand topic coverage: ES modules, async/await patterns, closures, design patterns.
- Add tests and small exercises with solution branches.
- Introduce CI checks and example workflows.
